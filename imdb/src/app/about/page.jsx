            Welcome to my clone IMDb website! My name is Ivan, and I am the creator behind this project. As a movie enthusiast, I have always been drawn to the magic of cinema and the way it can transport us to different worlds and experiences. This passion inspired me to create a platform where movie lovers like myself can explore and discover new films and TV shows, as well as share their thoughts and opinions with others.

            With this website, I aimed to recreate the essence of IMDb while putting my own spin on it. By using Next.js 13 beta and TailwindCSS, I was able to build a modern and responsive platform that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. Whether you are looking for information on the latest blockbusters, or seeking out hidden gems, you can find it all here.

            Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy your time exploring the wonderful world of movies and TV shows with me.
